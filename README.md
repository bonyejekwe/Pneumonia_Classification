DS 4400 (Machine Learning and Data Mining 1) Final Project Spring 2023

<b> Title: </b> Pneumonia Classification

<b> Abstract: </b> In several sentences, summarize your project (e.g., think of a Tweet).

Documentation:

	1. Introduction: Summarize your project report in several paragraphs.
		a. What is the problem? For example, what are you trying to solve? Describe the motivation.
		Pneumonia is a medical condition characterized by inflammation of the air sacs (alveoli) in one or both lungs, usually caused by a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection. The inflammation causes the air sacs to fill with pus or other fluid, which can make it difficult to breathe and lead to symptoms such as coughing, fever, and chest pain.  One way to detect pneumonia is through chest x-rays. A chest X-ray can help detect pneumonia by showing the inflammation and fluid buildup in the lungs. An x-ray classifier would be a helpful tool for the healthcare industry. For one, it can allow for early detection: Pneumonia can be difficult to diagnose in its early stages, as its symptoms are similar to those of other respiratory illnesses. When caught early, patient outcomes are likely to be better. Secondly, it would be an efficient diagnosis: an X-ray classifier can quickly and accurately diagnose pneumonia by analyzing chest X-rays. This can save time and resources compared to traditional diagnostic methods, such as laboratory tests, which can be time-consuming and expensive. 
		b. Why is this problem interesting? Is this problem helping us solve a bigger task in some 			way? Where would we find use cases for this problem?
		c. What is the approach you propose to tackle the problem? What approaches make sense for 		this problem? Would they work well or not? Feel free to speculate here based on what we 		taught in class.
		d. Why is the approach a good approach compared with other competing methods? For 			example, did you find any reference for solving this problem previously? If there are, how does 		your approach differ from theirs?
		e. What are the key components of my approach and results? Also, include any specific 			limitations.
	2. Setup: Set up the stage for your experimental results.
		a. Describe the dataset, including its basic statistics.
		b. Describe the experimental setup, including what models you are going to run, what 			parameters you plan to use, and what computing environment you will execute on.
		c. Describe the problem setup (e.g., for neural networks, describe the network structure that 		you are going to use in the experiments).
	3. Results: Describe the results from your experiments.
		a. Main results: Describe the main experimental results you have; this is where you highlight 		the most interesting findings.
		b. Supplementary results: Describe the parameter choices you have made while running the 		experiments. This part goes into justifying those choices.
	4. Discussion: Discuss the results obtained above. If your results are very good, see if you could 	compare them with some existing approaches that you could find online. If your results are not as 	good as you had hoped for, make a good-faith diagnosis about what the problem is.
	5. Conclusion: In several sentences, summarize what you have done in this project.
	6. References: Put any links, papers, blog posts, or GitHub repositories that you have borrowed 	from/found useful here.
